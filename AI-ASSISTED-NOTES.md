 # AI-Assisted Notes

## AI Tools Used
AI tools such as ChatGPT were used only for learning and conceptual understanding during this assignment.

## Purpose of AI Assistance
AI assistance was used for the following purposes:
- Understanding what an AI agent is and how agent-based systems work
- Learning how an AI agent can invoke tools in a controlled workflow
- Exploring high-level approaches for Markdown validation
- Clarifying design choices such as agent vs tool separation

## How Learning Was Converted into My Own Implementation
The final implementation is entirely my own work. AI tools were not used to generate or copy-paste code.

After understanding the concepts through AI assistance:
- I designed a custom AI agent workflow suitable for Markdown validation
- I chose the Agno framework to implement the agent logic
- I implemented a Python-based validation tool using my own logic and rules
- I designed the validation checks such as broken links and empty headings manually
- I integrated Flask to create a local web interface for file upload and result display

Every line of code was written, tested, and understood by me, and I am able to explain all design decisions and logic used in the project.

## Integrity Statement
This project follows the integrity guidelines provided in the assignment. AI tools were used only as learning aids, and the final solution reflects my own understanding and implementation.
